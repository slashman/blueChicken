## About The Project

</div>

Blue Chicken is a very traditional first person dungeon crawler: Your mission is to find the blue chicken who
is at the end of a sequence of rooms that gets rearranged every time you play; in these rooms youâ€™ll have to
solve puzzles and fight your way through, as you find magical artifacts that make you powerful.

This is a speed dungeon crawler where the goal is to finish as quick as possible!

## Development

The project is provided in a very simplified form; there is no building process, the contents of the `web` directory
are ready to be served, and comprise the source code of the game itself.
